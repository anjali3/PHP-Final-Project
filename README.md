# PHP-Final-Project
This project was made by: Anjali Patel for the Server-Side web programming class Final Project.
In this program I utilized MAMP server to run the database and Php code. This is an Online Virus
checker program, where it checks for putative and malware infected files. It has access to both admin
and user. From the file they upload it will return them first 20 malware bytes in the file.
